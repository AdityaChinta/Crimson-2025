  dialogueLines:
  - Why did you crawl back to me?
  - "It seems you are self-righteous right till the end.\r\nSylvia sacrificed herself
    and you have rendered it useless\u2026.kekeke\r"
  - That naive girl had no clue what we were up to.She broke the footing to allow
    you to escape right as we were about to kill you.
  - She was cursed by Zarvok to lose her Elf nature and turn into a sinister dark
    elf.
  - 'kekeke you always were clever.

    Ah,it seems I need to kill you for my desires
    to be fulfilled.'
  - It seems you are as naive as Ulkran told me.Your sworn brothers swore their allegiance
    to me.They were far greedier and sinister than you ever knew.
