  dialogueLines:
  - What do you want?We are in a dire shortage of patience and energy.
  - "We failed to fulfill our duty.It doesn\u2019t matter what we once were."
  - Our own men,who took the vow to die protecting the kingdom,betrayed us.
  - "We fought and shed blood together and I couldn\u2019t protect my men as they
    released our prisoners."
  - Yes,how do you know?
  - I will help,but you need to kill them no matter what.
